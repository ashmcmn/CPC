There is a one-dimensional garden of length N. In each position of the N length garden, a fountain has been installed. Given an array a[] such that a[i] describes the coverage limit of ith fountain. A fountain can cover the range from the position max(i â€“ a[i], 1) to min(i + a[i], N). In beginning, all the fountains are switched off.
